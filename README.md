# Bio-metric Access

# System


## Biometric Recognition

- Vein Pattern can also be used for biometric identification
- They are Unique
- Invariant for a long time
- Nearly impossible to copy or forge


## Advantages

- Detection is contactless
- Parameter is hidden from general view
- Vein patterns are very intricate so allow sufficient criteria to positively
    detect many subjects
- Easily collectible
- Extremely difficult to circumvent
